Mini Profile Card App
Overview
This is a small React application built using TypeScript to show profile cards. Each card displays a person's name, age, and email address. There's also a button that reveals the person's bio when clicked. This project helps practise using React components, props, state, event handling, and TypeScript to ensure the code is typed and safe.

Features
Reusable ProfileCard component that takes name, age, and email as props.

Displays a button labelled Show Bio that toggles the display of a short biography.

The bio is passed as children to the component, making it flexible.

Uses React’s useState hook to manage the toggle state of the bio.

TypeScript provides clear and strict typing for props and event handlers.

Simple yet effective styling using CSS Modules for clean, modular CSS.

Responsive layout that looks good on both small and large screens.

Accessibility considerations, such as proper ARIA attributes on the toggle button.
