Mini Profile Card App
Introduction
This project is a small React application designed to display profile cards for different people. Each card shows basic details like name, age, and email. You can also toggle a short biography for each person using a button. The app is built using React with TypeScript to ensure type safety and better code quality.

Features
ProfileCard component:
Reusable card that accepts several properties (name, age, email) and shows them clearly.

Toggle Biography:
Each card has a “Show Bio” button that reveals or hides a short biography or description.

TypeScript support:
All props and state are strictly typed to avoid errors and make the code easier to maintain.

Simple, clean design:
The cards are styled with soft colours, shadows, and rounded corners for a pleasant look.

Responsive layout:
Cards arrange nicely on different screen sizes and devices.

Technologies Used
React: For building user interfaces with reusable components

TypeScript: Adds static typing on top of JavaScript, helping catch errors early

CSS Modules: For locally scoped, clean CSS styles applied to components

Vite or Create React App: Project scaffolding tools to quickly start development with React + TypeScript

How to Run
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer.

Clone or download this repository.

Open a terminal in the project directory.

Run npm install to install all dependencies.

Run npm run dev (if using Vite) or npm start (if using Create React App) to start the development server.

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 (CRA) or the URL shown in terminal (Vite).

You can now see the profile cards, toggle bios, and view everything styled nicely.
