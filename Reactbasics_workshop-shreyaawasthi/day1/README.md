About Section: Presented as a pop-up modal with a brief introduction.

Projects Section: Lists projects dynamically generated from JavaScript data.

Contact Form: Includes name, email, and message fields, with validation to ensure correct input.

Experience Calculator: Allows users to calculate their coding experience by entering a start year.

Dark and Light Mode: A button toggles between light and dark themes for better usability.

Responsive Design: The layout adapts well to different screen sizes, from mobiles to desktops.

Technologies Used
HTML5: Semantic structure including header, nav, sections, and footer.

CSS3: Utilises Flexbox and Grid for layout, media queries for responsive design, and transitions for smooth effects.

JavaScript (ES6+): Handles dynamic rendering, form validation, event handling, and dark mode toggling.

How to View
Clone or download the repository.

Open the index.html file directly in any modern web browser.

Navigate the site and try out features like the contact form and experience calculator.

Notes on Implementation
The About section uses a modal for a clean pop-up effect, keeping the main page tidy.

Projects are stored in a JavaScript array and rendered dynamically, making it easy to add or edit projects.

Form validation prevents submission without proper inputs, providing clear error or success messages.

Dark mode switch changes colours across the entire site for comfort in different lighting conditions.

All code is written with readability and maintainability in mind.
